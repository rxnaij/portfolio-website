Hey, I'm Richard! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a UX designer interested in tech that is human-first and inspires positive well-being.

**Currently**: Iâ€™m seeking a full-time, entry-level UX/product design role where I can help talented teams solve real human needs. I'm particularly excited about applying my design and front-end skills in a real-world setting.
