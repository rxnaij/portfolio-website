Hey, I'm Richard! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a product designer and human being focused on technology that delights people and inspires compassion.

**Currently**: Iâ€™m seeking a full-time product design role where I can help talented design teams solve real human needs. I'm particularly excited about using my front-end development skills to bridge gaps between design and engineering.
