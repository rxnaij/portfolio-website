title: "About Me"

---

Hey, I'm Richard! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a designer, developer, and human being who loves creating technology that delights, inspires, and and spreads compassion.

I'm currently seeking a full-time role where I can help talented design and engineering teams build products that solve real human needs. I'm particularly excited about using my skills to bridge gaps between design and code.

As a kid of Web 2.0, I admired the Internet’s boundless potential for expression, and hoped to create my own sites, games and apps some day. However, years of boring computer science classes with discouraging teachers made me feel like I wasn’t cut out for it. (My other dream was, and still is, to become a writer.)

At least, that was until college, when I was assigned to make a website for a student conference. I read tons of articles about web design best practices (and discovered the world of UX design in the process), watched courses on HTML and CSS, and brushed up on digital marketing. Despite having no web experience, I created a live site used by hundreds of people to find important info, and loved doing it!

Since then, I created my own Digital Design and User Experience major in college, taught myself React and front-end development, and designed and coded a number of websites and web apps. Today, in a time where tech can be as overwhelming as it is helpful, I believe my role as a designer is to recognize the responsibility that tech has on others’ lives, and to harness it for human good.
