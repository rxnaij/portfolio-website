title: "About Me"

---

Hey, I'm Richard! I'm a product designer, developer, and human being invested in creating technology that delights and inspires compassion. 

**Currently, I’m seeking a full-time product designer role where I can help talented design teams solve real human needs.**

I believe design (and tech in general) should be about people first. I’m particularly interested in design for mental health/positive wellbeing. I also love building out my projects, and am self-taught in web development, including HTML, CSS, JS, and React (which I used to build this site!)

A little about me: growing up, I always enjoyed tinkering around on the web, but never felt like I had the “talent” for computer science (I stuck to writing and humanities courses). Then in college, despite having zero design experience, I was tasked to create a website for a large student conference! The work opened my eyes to the world of UX design, and I found it so fun and fulfilling that I created my own major in Digital Design and User Experience.

In my free time, I like taking morning walks, playing video games, and practicing guitar. I’m currently resisting the urge to buy a PS5.
