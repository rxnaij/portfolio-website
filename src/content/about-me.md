title: "About Me"

---

Hey, I'm Richard! Thanks for stopping by. I'm a designer, developer, and human being who loves creating technology that delights, inspires, and and spreads compassion.

I'm currently seeking a **full-time role** where I can help talented design and engineering teams build solutions to real human needs. I'm particularly excited about using my skills to bridge gaps between design and code.

As a Web 2.0 kid, I loved tinkering around on the web, from drag-and-drop site builders to wikis. But years of boring and gatekeepy computer science classes discouraged me from pursuing that interest further.

Then in college, I was tasked with creating a club website, and oh boy, did that rekindle my love for the web. Not only did I love learning things like HTML/CSS and design trends, I was fascinated to discover that "design" meant much more than fancy aesthetics; it was a deliberate approach to solving real-world problems.

Since then, I created my own Digital Design and User Experience major in college, taught myself web development, and built a number of sites. Today, I believe my role as a technologist is to recognize the responsibility that tech has on othersâ€™ lives, and to harness it for human good.
