title: "About Me"

---

Hey, I'm Richard! I'm a self-taught product designer, developer, and human being. I want to create technology that delights and inspires compassion. Currently, I’m seeking a full-time product designer role where I can help talented design teams solve real human needs.

A little about me: as a kid, I always enjoyed tinkering around on the web, but I was turned off by boring computer science classes and discouraging teachers. Then in college, I was tasked to create a website for a large student conference, despite having no prior design experience! The work was so fun and fulfilling that I created my own major in Digital Design and User Experience.

I believe design (and tech in general) should be about people first and technology second. Some of my interests include the relationship between tech and mental health/positive wellbeing, using design to connect people with communities, and translating UIs into front-end code.

In my free time, I like taking morning walks, playing video games, and practicing guitar. I’m resisting the urge to buy a PS5.
